# 🎬 Rhea – AI Cinema Voice Booking Agent  
### Conversational AI-Powered Ticket Booking & Personalized Movie Recommendation System

Rhea is an intelligent voice-based booking assistant that recommends movies based on user mood and preferences, processes ticket reservations conversationally, and automates multi-channel confirmation — all through a scalable AI workflow system.

## 🚨 The Problem

Traditional ticket booking platforms:

- Require manual browsing
- Offer generic recommendations
- Lack conversational engagement
- Create friction in booking flow
- Do not provide intelligent mood-based suggestions

Users want fast, intuitive, voice-driven booking experiences.
